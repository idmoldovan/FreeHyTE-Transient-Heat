# FreeHyTE-Transient-Heat
FreeHyTE - Transient Heat uses the temperature model of the hybrid-Trefftz finite element formulation for the solution of 2D transient heat
conduction problems with interior heat generation. It can be used, in a more general context, for the solution of 2D non-homogeneous 
parabolic boundary value problems with arbitrary source terms.
